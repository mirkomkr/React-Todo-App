# React Todo App

## 📚 Project Overview

A modern and responsive Todo List application built with **React**. This project was developed to showcase core front-end development skills, including state management with React Hooks and data persistence. It's a clean, user-friendly app that helps users track their tasks and deadlines.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Create and Manage Tasks**: Easily add new tasks with a due date.
* **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or unwanted tasks.
* **Persistent Data**: Tasks are saved to the browser's **Local Storage**, so they won't be lost on page refresh.

* **Planned Feature**: The ability to modify existing tasks is a planned feature for a future update.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
